      <p>Apart from being a mobile &amp; web developer,
        I enjoy most of my time being indoors because 365 days of summer. Travel almost every continent in world,
         and Mingle around developer communities,
        is part of my enjoyment and self-improvement.
        </p>
      <p>
      When indoors (like very much), I follow a number of sci-fi and
      fantasy genre movies and decent anime shows,
      <strike> I am the one who cooks</strike>I am like to learn cooking, while I spend a large amount
      of my free time exploring the latest technology
      advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
